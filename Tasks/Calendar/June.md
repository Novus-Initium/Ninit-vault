June has two main focal points. The first being IMPs, developing, and finding a way to deploy the IMPs contract to the Doric Network.

Secondly we need to refine the Doric Whitepaper v1 and revamp it prior to organizing a second version for Doric L2 Whitepaper v1

At a lower priority, we must continue working with AI and integrating RAG models with Ninit information and utilize a specialized agent to help Ninit produce it's Manifesto and related documentation.
