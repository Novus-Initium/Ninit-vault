### Overview of Allo Protocol

Allo Protocol is a decentralized framework designed for managing and distributing funds within communities. The protocol primarily consists of the following components:

1. **Core Contract (Allo.sol)**
2. **Allocation Strategies**
3. **Project Registry**

### Key Components and Contracts

#### 1. Core Contract (Allo.sol)

**Purpose:**

- Manages the lifecycle of pools: creation, funding, allocation, and distribution of funds.
- Provides a consistent interface for interacting with various allocation strategies.

**Key Methods:**

- **`createPool`** and **`createPoolWithCustomStrategy`**: Initialize pools with a standard or custom allocation strategy.
- **`fundPool`**: Add funds to a pool.
- **`allocate`** and **`batchAllocate`**: Allocate funds according to the pool's allocation strategy.
- **`distribute`**: Distribute allocated funds to recipients.
- **`recoverFunds`**: Recover remaining funds from a pool.

#### 2. Allocation Strategies

**Purpose:**

- Define the logic for recipient eligibility, allocation of funds, and distribution mechanisms.
- Each pool is associated with one allocation strategy which dictates how funds are managed.

**Key Methods (IStrategy.sol Interface):**

- **`initialize`**: Setup strategy when a pool is created.
- **`registerRecipient`**: Add new recipients to the pool.
- **`allocate`**: Allocate funds to recipients based on the strategy’s logic.
- **`distribute`**: Handle the distribution of allocated funds to recipients.

**Types of Allocation Strategies:**

- Cloneable strategies provided by Allo.
- Custom strategies developed by users.

#### 3. Project Registry

**Purpose:**

- Maintains an on-chain registry of profiles (projects) participating in the Allo ecosystem.
- Profiles represent entities that can create or participate in pools.

**Profile Structure:**

- **Id**: Unique identifier.
- **Name**: Project name.
- **Metadata**: Off-chain data (e.g., stored on IPFS).
- **Owner Address**: Primary owner of the profile.
- **Member Addresses**: Associated members.

**Role Management:**

- **Owner**: Can update profile metadata, manage members, and transfer ownership.
- **Member**: Associated with the profile but with limited privileges.

### Interaction Between Contracts

1. **Creating a Pool**:
    
    - A profile from the Project Registry creates a pool using `createPool` or `createPoolWithCustomStrategy` on Allo.sol.
    - The pool is linked to the profile and an allocation strategy is set.
2. **Funding a Pool**:
    
    - Pools can be funded during creation or later via the `fundPool` method on Allo.sol.
    - Funds can be in Ether or an ERC20 token, but a pool can only handle one type of token.
3. **Allocating Funds**:
    
    - Allocation of funds is done through the `allocate` method on Allo.sol, which delegates the logic to the pool’s allocation strategy.
    - Strategies determine how allocation decisions are made (e.g., voting, donations).
4. **Distributing Funds**:
    
    - The `distribute` method on Allo.sol is used to distribute allocated funds to recipients.
    - The allocation strategy manages the specifics of distribution, ensuring funds are distributed correctly.
5. **Managing Profiles**:
    
    - Profiles in the Project Registry can be created, updated, and managed through specific methods in the registry contract.
    - Profiles can hold metadata and manage ownership and member roles.
