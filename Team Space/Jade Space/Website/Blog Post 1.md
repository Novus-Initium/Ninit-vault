## Our Journey

Since 2018, we've been on a mission to empower individuals like you through education and governance in the ever-evolving world of Web3. It all began with courses on Web3 onboarding and cryptography. Fast forward to today, and we’re hosting Web3 Wednesdays, leading study groups, and participating in hackathons, all to fuel our community’s journey in the Web3 space.
