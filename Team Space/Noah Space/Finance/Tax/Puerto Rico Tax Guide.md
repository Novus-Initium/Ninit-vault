Puerto Rico offers a unique tax structure that is different from that of the U.S. mainland, primarily because it is a U.S. territory and not a state. This allows Puerto Rico to have a separate tax system while still under U.S. federal jurisdiction for certain types of taxes.

### Tax Residency

To benefit fully from Puerto Rico's tax incentives, a business owner must become a bona fide resident. This involves:

- **Physical Presence**: Spend at least 183 days per year in Puerto Rico.
- **Tax Home**: Establish your primary place of business in Puerto Rico.
- **Closer Connection**: Demonstrate stronger personal connections to Puerto Rico than to any other jurisdiction.

### Personal Income Tax

As a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico, you are subject to local income taxes, which are administered by the Puerto Rico Department of Treasury (Hacienda). Key aspects include:

- **Tax Rates**: Puerto Rico's income tax rates are progressive, ranging from 0% to 33%. This is similar to U.S. federal income tax brackets but administered locally.
- **Filing Status**: Like the U.S., you can file as single, married (jointly or separately), or head of household.
- **Deductions and Exemptions**: You can claim deductions and exemptions similar to those on the U.S. mainland, such as personal exemptions, dependent exemptions, and standard or itemized deductions.

### ***Act 60 – Individual Investors Act***

***This act, previously known as Act 22, offers significant tax incentives to attract individual investors to relocate to Puerto Rico:***

- ***0% Tax on Dividends and Interest: No local taxes on dividends and interest income received by residents.***
- ***0% Tax on Capital Gains: Long-term capital gains accrued after becoming a resident are taxed at 0%. This includes gains from the sale of securities and other assets.***

### Social Security and Medicare

As a U.S. territory, residents of Puerto Rico still contribute to Social Security and Medicare, similar to taxpayers in the states. This is important for business owners who pay themselves a salary.

### Implications for Business Owners

- **Corporation vs. Pass-Through Entities**: If your business is structured as a corporation, you may pay yourself a salary, which is subject to Puerto Rico's income tax as well as Social Security and Medicare taxes. If your business is a pass-through entity (like an LLC or partnership), the business income passes through to your personal tax return and is taxed according to local individual tax rates.
- **Double Taxation**: Although Puerto Rico residents are generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on Puerto Rico-sourced income, issues of double taxation might still arise in specific situations, particularly with federal taxes like FICA.

### Additional Considerations

- **Tax Planning**: It’s crucial for business owners to engage in careful tax planning, especially if they are considering moving to Puerto Rico mainly for tax reasons.
- **Professional Advice**: Due to the complexities of the tax laws and the potential for significant financial impact, it’s advisable to consult with tax professionals who specialize in Puerto Rican and U.S. tax law.

### Conclusion

Puerto Rico offers attractive tax incentives that can significantly reduce personal and corporate tax liabilities for business owners. However, understanding and navigating the tax laws require careful planning and consultation with tax professionals. This system aims to promote economic growth in Puerto Rico by attracting entrepreneurs and investors to the island.
