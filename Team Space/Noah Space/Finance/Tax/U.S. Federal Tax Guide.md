### 1. Types of Business Entities and Their Tax Implications

**Sole Proprietorship**:

**Partnership**:

**Limited Liability Company (LLC)**:

- Can be taxed as a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation, depending on the elections made by the LLC and its number of members.

**Corporation**:

- **C-Corp**: A separate legal entity that pays corporate income tax on its profits (Form 1120). Shareholders are also taxed on any dividends received.
- **S-Corp**: Allows income, losses, deductions, and credits to pass through to shareholders, who report them on their personal tax returns. Must file Form 1120S.
