## Types of USDA Loans

There are two main types of USDA loans:

### Guaranteed Loan Program

This loan is issued by approved lenders and guaranteed by the USDA, protecting lenders against losses. It is aimed at moderate-income borrowers.

### Direct Loan Program

This loan is issued directly by the USDA to low- and very-low-income applicants. The loan terms are more favorable, including potentially lower interest rates and extended repayment periods.

## Application Process

The application process involves several steps:

### Step 1: Prequalification

Determine your eligibility by checking income and property requirements. Gather financial documents, such as pay stubs, tax returns, and bank statements.

### Step 2: Find a Lender

For the Guaranteed Loan Program, find a USDA-approved lender. The USDA website provides a list of approved lenders.

### Step 3: Apply for Preapproval

Submit a preapproval application with your chosen lender. This step involves a preliminary review of your financial situation.

### Step 4: Find a Home

Work with a real estate agent to find a home in an eligible rural area. Ensure the property meets USDA standards.

### Step 5: Complete the Application

Submit a full application with all required documents. The lender will review and underwrite your application.

### Step 6: Loan Processing and Closing

Once approved, the lender will process the loan and set a closing date. Attend the closing to sign final documents and complete the purchase.
