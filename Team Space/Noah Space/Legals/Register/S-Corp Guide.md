### What is an S-Corporation?

An S-Corporation (S-Corp) is a type of corporation that meets specific Internal Revenue Code requirements. The designation allows the corporation to pass corporate income, losses, deductions, and credits through to their shareholders for federal tax purposes. Shareholders of S-Corps report the pass-through of income and losses on their personal tax returns and are taxed at their individual income tax rates. This allows S-Corps to avoid double taxation on the corporate income.

### Benefits of an S-Corporation

1. **Tax Savings**:
    
    - **Pass-through Taxation**: S-Corps benefit from pass-through taxation where the income is taxed at the shareholder level rather than at the corporate level, preventing the double taxation often associated with C-Corporations.
2. **Independent Life**:
    
    - An S-Corp is a separate legal entity, which means it can continue even if the owner leaves or passes away.
3. **Investment Opportunities**:
    
    - S-Corps can attract investors through the sale of shares, although the number and type of allowable shareholders are limited.
4. **Limited Liability Protection**:
    
    - Shareholders generally have limited liability protection, meaning they are typically not personally responsible for business debts and liabilities.
5. **Credibility**:
    
    - Registering as an S-Corp can provide a business with added credibility among vendors and potential partners.
