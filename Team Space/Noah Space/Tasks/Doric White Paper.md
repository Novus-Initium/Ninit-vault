### Table of Contents

The table of contents appears well-organized, but there are some redundant entries and inconsistent section numbering:

- [ ] Combine sections 2.2 and 3.2 as "The Doric Ecosystem" appears twice.
- [ ] Similarly, merge sections 2.3 and 3.3 since "Security and Innovation" is repeated.
- [x] Sections 4 and 5 should be numbered and titled consistently with the rest of the document.
