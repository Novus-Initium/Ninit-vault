##### Introduction


It is almost impossible to determine the origin point of money, as the concept itself is older than written history. It is speculated that recognizable currencies emerged predating the wheel, upwards of seven thousand years ago. In this way, all of both history as we know to modern societal behaviors has been deeply influenced by money.

This monetary system has evolved dynamically in millennium of human habitation, but overall taking two broad forms including money of account such as debits and credits on ledgers and money of exchange, tangible media of from clay, leather, paper, wood, metal or other material. Doric look to again focus on these Real world Assets (RWAs), as they have long helped consumers have a peace of mind in their ownership of something.

When money transitioned into the form of digital data, it marked a significant evolution in the global economy, transforming how both businesses and individuals operate and accumulate wealth. This shift transcended traditional borders and timeframes, enabling instantaneous transactions across the globe. Consequently, businesses gained unprecedented opportunities to expand their markets and streamline their operations, fostering a new era of competitiveness and innovation. 

Digital currencies and fintech solutions democratize access to financial services, allowing even the smallest enterprises to participate in the global economy. This digital transformation not only accelerated the pace of business but also reshaped the competitive landscape, driving companies to quickly adapt and innovate continually. Doric's main goal is to democratize and share real world  resources on the blockchain, together as a community.

  

##### So what is Doric?

  
  Doric (DRC) was conceptualized within this deeply connected digital economy revolution, gathering the quintessential aspects like security, interactivity, transparency, technology, and usability (More RWA aspects here). DRC is a cryptocurrency that fuels the Doric ecosystem and blockchain, acting as a settlement mechanism for various DApps on the Doric blockchain.

Contract management and exchanges will be conducted through DORIC's exclusive platform. Doric will provide valuable integration with organizations and notary offices, with the goal of having Dorie's smart contract accepted as a legal and official sales and purchase document.

  

Doric is much more than a transaction platform. It is a blockchain network where the buying and selling processes are assisted and supported by various programs, such as our Ambassador program, in which participants will offer all legal solutions in all countries of operation.

  

#### Buy & Sell Market

The digital payment market is expected to grow rapidly over the next few decades, due to multiple factors including both worldwide initiatives to promote online payments and the high proliferation of smartphones which allows convenient mass access to digital markets. This in turn increases e-commerce sales and catalyze the entry of people and businesses into digital based economies, snowballing the process.

  
As of mid-2024, the cryptocurrency sector boasts an impressive market capitalization of approximately $1.5 trillion, encompassing a diverse array of digital assets, including major players like Bitcoin and Ethereum, alongside numerous altcoins. This growth reflects a robust and active market, with significant liquidity facilitated through both centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). 

Daily trading volumes have surged to over $100 billion with strong participation from both retail and institutional investors. 

Looking ahead, this market is expected to expand dramatically, with projections suggesting a market cap of $5 trillion by 2030. This growth will be fueled by ongoing technological advancements and increasing mainstream adoption. The financial services segment that supports the buying and selling of digital assets is poised to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 15%-20% in the coming decade. 


As regulatory frameworks around the globe become more defined, the market is likely to see reduced volatility and greater institutional participation. 

Countries with crypto-friendly regulations will likely emerge as key hubs for digital asset trading and innovation. Additionally, the integration of crypto assets into traditional finance is deepening, with banks and financial institutions offering services such as crypto custody and trading, and the development of stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) bridging the gap between conventional and digital finance.
  

The leading providers of digital payment solutions are gradually adopting smart technologies such as cloud computing, analytics, and big data, to offer comprehensive solutions to potential customers. Payment gateway and payment processing are the most widely demanded solutions among traders around the world.





  
  

The adoption of Open Banking APls and progressive changes in the regulatory framework are a great opportunity

North America estimated to remain as the largest market through 2025.  
  

At Doric, we strive to continually maintain a system that solves the following problems:

  

- Lack of Global standards for international payments
    
- Lack of security in transactions
    
- Tech availability in the entirety of a population
    
- Constricting level of bureaucracy
    

  

We believe in Blockchain is a uniquely posed technology to solve these problems in a way more effective than seen before. 

  
  

# What is Blockchain ?

The blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that securely records transactions in a transparent and unchangeable manner. Each transaction is time-stamped and added to a chain of previous records, forming a continuous sequence known as the blockchain. These records are simultaneously replicated and shared across a network of computers, ensuring their accuracy and integrity. 

This distributed nature makes the blockchain both resilient and highly secure, as it is virtually impossible to alter or tamper with the data without consensus from the entire network.


Blockchain technology was first conceptualized in 2008 by an anonymous figure known as Satoshi Nakamoto, who introduced it as the foundation for Bitcoin, the world's first decentralized cryptocurrency. This innovative system allowed for secure, transparent, and immutable recording of digital transactions without the need for a central authority. Bitcoin's blockchain launched in 2009, marking the beginning of a new era in digital finance by creating a public ledger where all transactions were permanently recorded and visible to anyone on the network.

The potential of blockchain technology extended far beyond Bitcoin. In 2013, Vitalik Buterin proposed Ethereum, a new blockchain platform that introduced the concept of smart contracts—self-executing agreements coded directly into the blockchain. Ethereum's launch in 2015 enabled the development of decentralized applications (DApps) across various sectors, allowing for the digital transfer of non-financial assets and automated processes. This evolution demonstrated blockchain's versatility, expanding its use cases from financial transactions to complex digital interactions across numerous industries.

### Key Concepts for Understanding Blockchain

1. **Transaction**:
    - **Definition**: The basic unit of activity within a blockchain, representing the transfer of data or value between participants.
    - **Example**: Sending cryptocurrency from one user to another.
2. **Block**:
    - **Definition**: A container that holds a list of transactions. Each block is linked to the previous one, forming a chain.
    - **Example**: Think of it as a page in a ledger that records multiple transactions.
3. **Merkle Root Hash**:
    - **Definition**: A single hash that represents all transactions in a block. It’s derived from the Merkle tree, a hierarchical structure of hashes.
    - **Example**: Like a fingerprint for the entire set of transactions in a block, ensuring data integrity.
4. **Previous Block Hash**:
    - **Definition**: The hash of the preceding block in the chain. It links the current block to its predecessor.
    - **Example**: Acts as a link in the chain, connecting each block to the one before it.
5. **Block Hash**:
    - **Definition**: A unique identifier for a block, generated by hashing the block’s contents (including the previous block hash, transactions, and other data).
    - **Example**: It’s like a digital signature for a block, ensuring its authenticity and immutability.
6. **Timestamp**:
    - **Definition**: The date and time when a block was created. It provides a chronological order to the blockchain.
    - **Example**: A digital timestamp on each block, similar to a date stamp on a document.
7. **Block Version**:
    - **Definition**: An identifier for the software version that created the block. It can indicate the protocol rules that the block follows.
    - **Example**: It’s like a version number for the block, ensuring compatibility with the network’s software.
8. **Mining**:
    - **Definition**: The process of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain by solving complex mathematical puzzles.
    - **Example**: Miners use computational power to solve puzzles, and the first to solve it adds the block and earns a reward.
9. **Genesis Block**:
    - **Definition**: The first block in a blockchain, also known as Block 0. It’s the foundation of the entire blockchain.
    - **Example**: The inaugural page of a ledger that starts the chain of recorded transactions.
  
  
  
  
  
    


  

Clients using the platform layer can access an application developed on top of a blockchain network. The blockchain layers have the following characteristics:

  

Decentralization: Blockchain transactions are processed and validated by the consensus of the majority of nodes (they allow communication between computers) in the network. They are replicated among the other nodes. This eliminates the need for an intermediary to share and maintain transaction data.

  

Immutability: Blockchain transactions are stored sequentially in blocks., each block in the chain being linked to the previous block using a cryptographic hash function. Any attempt to modify the contents of one block will affect all subsequent blocks in the chain., making tampering or fraud on the blockchain all but impossible.

  

Transparency: The block is only updated when the majority of nodes reach a consensus. Changes in the network are publicly visible, ensuring transparency and security.

  

Traceability: The distributed and transparent nature of blockchain makes it easy to trace any transaction event. Every update to the state of an asset can be traced back to its origin. This helps make the network more secure, efficient, and transparent.

  

# Transaction System

The user hashes the transaction data using a hash function for later verification of data integrity. The hashed data is encrypted using the user's private key to provide user authentication and the encrypted output is known as the digital signature of this transaction. The transaction data and the signature are transmitted to the network.

# Types of blockchain

The technology has evolved over time due to its adoption by different types of application domains, such as healthcare, education, logistics, governance, and robotics. This evolution is classified into 4 layers, as shown in:

  
  
  
  

Blockchain 3.0 or third generation bl9ckc.hqin tDor1cJ

  
  
  
  
  
  

Blockchain 1.0 or first generation

blockchain (Bitcoin)

Blockchain 2.0 or second qeneration plocchaiq lEthereumJ  



  
  

Blockchain architecture is centered on the public or the private network. A public blockchain network, also called a permissionless blockchain, allows anyone to join the network without permission. The private blockchain, also known as permissioned, is an invitation-only network by an authentication authority. The network involves access control rights for queries and updates

to the ledger.

# Nodes & Contracts

The technology has evolved over time due to its adoption by different types of application domains, such as healthcare, education, logistics, governance, and robotics. This evolution is classified into 4 layers, as shown in:

  
  (network of node diagram)
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
  

Simply defined, a node is any device connected to a blockchain network but not all nodes can store a complete copy of a blockchain. A full node will have stored all relevant blockchain information, including a record of all recordings and transactions.

  

These data transmitters are considered the same, but this means some of them have diversified potential in their ability to support the network and blockchain ecosystem. 

  

The process works as follows: a node downloads a complete copy of a blockchain, checking the new incoming transactions based on the consensus protocol used by this cryptography.

  

Nodes use the same consensus protocol to remain compatible with each other. It is responsible for validating transactions and putting them into blocks. Nodes always get to a conclusion about the validity of a transaction and whether it should be added to a block with other transactions.


Blockchain validators are responsible for running nodes and attesting to transactions within the network. They rely on a few main different consensus mechanism known as Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Proof of Authority.


Proof of Stake (PoS) - also know as Proof of Participation


In this method, the more blocks a miner already has inside a blockchain, the more blocks he will be able to mine. Proof of Stake means that an individual who wishes to mine or validate a transaction on the blockchain can do so depending on how many token he already has. 

As the name implies, the more tokens or 'stake' the miner has on the blockchain, the more mining power he receives on the blockchain.

  

Proof of Work (PoW)

Proof of Work is the original consensus mechanism designed fore Bitcoin and is still utilized by  many cryptocurrencies today. It involves miners racing to solve complex mathematical puzzles in order to validate transactions and add new blocks to a chain. The miners that solve the problems the quickest are rewarded, typically in the form of the blockchains native currency. 

In this case, the greater the computing power, the more transactions can be confirmed on the blockchain. Pow is the conventional method by which new blocks are created after transactions are completed. In this system, the algorithm confirms transactions and produces new blocks while miners compete with each other to complete transactions and receive bounties. Each block gives a certain number of bounties to the miner who completes the transaction.

  

Proof of Authority (PoA)

Is a consensus method in which multiple blockchain validators within the ecosystem have the power to validate transactions and decide whether new blocks will be added to the blockchain or not. The PoA method is not suitable for public blockchains, as there is essentially a monopoly with a few validators that can confirm the transactions.

des a comprehensive and integrated ecosystem that facilitates the transition of the process of buying and selling assets or non-consumable assets to the blockchain through the Doric platform and its own ecosystem.

  
  

The Doric platform environment is intended for communities that have the tools, applications and solutions aimed at seamless integration with registrars, notaries and governmental institutions while maintaining compliance with the legalities of each country, state, and city.

In recent years, several countries - including Georgia Japan, and the United Arab Emirates - have moved forward with a blockchain-based property registry to "clarify ownership" and improve transaction efficiency. Perhaps the most strightforward appllication of technology is found in the real estate market.


  

Specifically, in Japan, one of the goals of building a blockchain system is to update a fragmented property registration system, where government databases do not match the actual inhabitants of a property. In Dubai, real estate contracts are linked to the Dubai Electricity & Water Authority (DEWA) as well as to the telecommunications system and various property related accounts.

  

With efforts towards blockchain property registration already underway in the countries mentioned above, as well as rising interest in similar developments in the UK and India, Doric is well positioned to gain entry to this emerging market by making the experience of registering in both real estate and other durable assets in a simple intuitive and inviolable process.

  

Enrollment time and fees will be significantly reduced due to our simplified smart contract protocols. We are committed to ensuring that all services will engage with government re­ gulations in each jurisdiction while removing the probability of fraudulent transactions.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

# Smart Contracts

Smart contracts, simply defined, are self-fulfilling agreements between members of a network.  These are an essential application of Dorie's blockchain technology.


With smart contracts, any information inserted is automatically handled according to the protocol previously agreed upon. Because this protocol is the single arbitrator of transactions, it can be executed in a transparent and conflict-free manner, without the high costs of other verification processes and time consuming intermediaries.

  

Doric's smart contracts allows 3 types of Products, they being:

  

Purchase Agreement, Property List (marketplace), Crowdsales and Property Tokenization

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  



Property List (marketplace) example:

  
  
  
  

Crowdsales and Property Tokenization diagram:

  


  
  
  

These systems is only viable with the help of smart contracts from Dorie's Blockchain. It guarantees and makes every moment of the sales campaign transparent.

  

The Crowdsale and Property module for example, allows companies, developers, and owners to turn fractions tokens or percentages of their developments into financial assets in order to sell them at the launch stage.

  
  
  


###### Global Assistance

Doric Blockchain is an open source project initiative created by a worldwide community of developers, engineers, executives, designers, academics, economists and blockchain enthusiasts who have committed to include Dories in the main cryptocurrencies, thus making decentralized technologies accessible to everyone.

  

The main goal is to help with jurisdictional problems in all countries, as well as with the likely changes that may arise during the processes of buying and selling goods, whether technological or regulatory related. The only way forward is to have a team committed to helping solve all legal problems.

All users of the Doric platform are entitled to votes and opinions at a rate of l to l, token per vote.

  

Anyone in the network can contribute with their ideas, feedback, code, design, support and dissemination of the Doric project. As each location has its own jurisdiction, the ideas and questions relating to a specific region or area will always be discussed in the internal forum.

  

###### Use case of POA

Proof of Authority (PoA) is a consensus method that gives a small, designated number of blockchain participants the power to validate transactions or interactions with the network and update its distributed record.
  

Doric has chosen PoA over others like Pow mechanism, due to its many benefits. Unlike other high energy methods, Proof of Authority uses limited validator nodes to validate transactions and create new blocks based upon their reputation and identity

This consensus mechanism requires almost no computational power and therefore requires far less energy, making for quick and efficient throughput. 

    

ADPoS Benetits

Doric relies on the ADPoS-based algorithm (Authority Delegated Proof of Stake), where transactions are authorized by selected validators, relying on the capital applied by Stakes.

  

This capital, besides making the network's transactions viable, will also provide security andreliability for the processing to occur.

  

Thus, the Stakes play a fundamental role in bringing credibility and viability to the network; in summary, the stake is the network's promoter.

  

The Stakes will be entitled to the platform's gains, such as: gas, currency appreciation, and profits from the project.

  
  

Own Blockchain

The DRC digital currency is the native cryptocurrency of the Doric Network and will remain the reserve cryptocurrency for all third-party applications running on the Doric Network.

  

As the protocol token for the Doric Network infrastructure, the DRC will be required for all parties using the Doric network to build applications or issue and integrate cryptographic tokens into their applications.

  

The supply of DRC is fixed, long-term, and non-inflationary. In addition, the DRC is an intrinsic part of the Doric Network for a number of reasons:

  
  


  

- Doric will be used to fund the development of the Doric Network and its ecosystem (DoricScan, DoricMaster, DoricWebWallet, etc.).
    

  

- Doric will be used as an incentive to build up the mechanics/ecosystem of the Doric Network mechanism/ ecosystem.
    

  

- Doric will be used as an instrument for long term decentralized governance of the Doric Network.
    

DRC is not mineable if not validated by masternodes. Masternodes are responsible for creating, verifying, and finalizing the blocks created in a period, called a season. Each masternode will receive rewards for blocking.

  

As such, the Doric platform is built on its own blockchain, bringing more credibility and greater security to the buying and selling transactions.

  

Dorie's distinguishing features: it is built on proprietary blockchain and, it has the Proof of Authority protocol:

  

The Doric Network supports all EVM-compliant smart contracts, protocols and atomic crosschain token transfers. This means that any smart contract written in the Ethereum protocol can be easily transferred to the Doric network.

- Blockchain technology allows verification without having to rely on a third party.
    

  

- Data cannot be altered or deleted.
    

  

- We use secured encryption to protect the data books. In addition, the current ledger depends on its adjacent block to complete the encryption process.
    

  

- All transactions and data are attached to the block after the maximum trust verification process. There is a consensus of all ledger participants on what is to be recorded in the block.
    

  

- Transactions are recorded in chronological order. Therefore, all blocks in the blockchain have date and timestamp.  
    

## Own Exchange

Doric also has its own exchange, which facilitates transfer patterns by minimizing fees.

  

In this model it is possible for buyers and sellers to interact, reducing the bureaucracy of the real estate acquisition processes.

  

## Online and Digital Registry

We unite the document registration platform with the world's most secure and immutable secure database: the Blockchain network.

  

The Doric Platform has reliable operations, optimized processes, records in chronological

order, and a considerable reduction in costs.

Our decentralized platform offers transparency and security, but these strengths also require us to be vigilant. We implement rigorous security measures and constantly update our protocols to protect against vulnerabilities. We work closely with our community of users and validators to monitor network activities and swiftly address any suspicious behavior. Additionally, we collaborate with regulatory bodies to ensure our compliance with evolving laws and standards. By taking these proactive steps, we strive to maintain a safe and trustworthy environment for all participants in our digital economy.
  

Legal - In order to expand our work in all countries, we will need to pay for the services of lawyers or legal consultants. As each place of action has different laws, we will have to pay for this process.

  

Operational - 27% of the funds will go towards operational costs.

  

WebSocket is a technology that allows bidirectional communication over full-duplex channels over a single Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) socket. It is designed to run on brow-sers and web servers that support HTML5, but can be used by any client or application server.

  
  

# Growth Target

  
  
  
  
  

This market will challenge current economic structures and allow instant transactions without interference from third­ party parties such as banks and governments.

  

Taking into account the growth of cryptocurrencies, bitcoin (which grew 270% by in 2020, reaching $27,000) and Ethereum (which has been accumulating a growth of 667% since the beginning of 2020), its possible to see a vast growth potential for Doric. This is due to the natural growth of a new ecosystem of financial solutions and the capital market, which is gaining new investors every year.




Once these cryptocurrencies enter the market, they become tradable and exchangeable financial assets, much like the traditional stock markets of fiat currency and other financial assets. Both of these types of markets can now share the important aspect of tangible representations of assets for consumer peace of mind. 

The demand for this market is high, some cryptocurrency exchanges have reached over a billion dollars in daily trading volume. showing telling results this new digital market is climbing the financial ladder much faster than any of its predecessors.

  

Today everyone can foresee very positive indicators of the global digital trading market and we are prepared to come to the table with a platform that ensures the best experience for all users involved.
