$INIT Airdrop
Total amount: 1,000,000 ex.

Claim based on snapshot of NFT holdings;
Rather value based, make claims percentage based? 

Bufficorns: .001%
Schizoposter: 0.003%
Remilangel: .00300%
ETHDenver Buidler Badge: .003%
Etc...: .001 - .005%

As the total supply minted increases the potential claimable mint decreases over time. (ex. At 1m unminted, 1 bufficorn holder can claim .01% of 1m tokens ~ 100 tokens. Now the next Bufficorn holder can now claim .01% of 9,999,900 tokens or ~ 99 tokens..)

I want to make these ratios and values based off my values (will be trickkyy, but ninitmen nfts, web hookers, and cryptoconductors can play a vital role in helping ensure a desired token distribution) [and can we allow them to mint first for a day / week, and also)
inform people like kevin and tayken that you would like them to mint early so they can have a larger distribution because you trust them

To increase the rate of change of this "deflationary" mechanism we can increase the amount pulled by percent and maintain relative ratios considering the projects eligible and their desired claim rates.
(Explore the game theory and desired time we wish for certain percentages to be minted)

(Allow a DAO to vote using $INIT, with longer time periods such as 30 day or 14 day voting periods, to vote on governance aspects such as adding or changing the mint process / adding collections which although potentially dangerous, weight votes much more heavily if connected to gitcoin passport to prevent voting in a malicious collection held by 1 owner to disrupt the fair distribution mechanism)
make it require $init token to propose to add contracts that can claim more init token. eventually a vote will pass to shorten the period from 30 (60? more?) days perhaps. (voting period to add contracts to expand tokens can be a different time length than voting on other aspects in the DAO)
