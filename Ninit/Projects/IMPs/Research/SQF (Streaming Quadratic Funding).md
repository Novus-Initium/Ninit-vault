#### Geo Web

1. **Augmented, Shared Reality**:
    
    - Geo Web enables users to anchor digital content (e.g., images, videos, 3D objects) to real-world locations.
    - Users can experience this content through smart devices based on their geolocation and field-of-view, creating a persistent, virtual layer over the physical world.
2. **Public Goods Emphasis**:
    
    - Geo Web promotes shared experiences, shared governance, and shared value.
    - It aims to prevent monopolistic control over digital experiences and ensures that augmented reality (AR) content benefits the public.
3. **Partial Common Ownership (PCO)**:
    
    - Geo Web features a digital land registry where publishers declare the value of their digital land parcels.
    - Publishers pay an annual 10% fee based on this valuation to the network treasury, encouraging honest valuations and productive use of land.
4. **Network Rules**:
    
    - The Geo Web operates with two rule sets:
        - **Augmented Reality Commons**: A public publishing space where AR content is anchored to the publisherâ€™s immediate physical vicinity.
        - **Partial Common Ownership Digital Land Registry**: Allows for controlled, private use of digital land while retaining common benefits.
5. **Technological Integration**:
    
    - Geo Web uses Superfluid's streaming token protocol to manage network fees dynamically and efficiently.
    - Super Apps and Constant Flow Agreement (CFA) Access Control List (ACL) functionalities from Superfluid enable custom logic and automated control of streams.

### Goals and Vision

1. **Shared Digital Reality**:
    
    - Geo Web envisions a world where AR enhances the physical world in a shared, consistent manner.
    - It seeks to replace isolated, siloed AR experiences with a unified digital layer accessible to all users.
2. **Strategic Scarcity**:
    
    - The network embraces strategic scarcity to filter AR content effectively, ensuring valuable and meaningful experiences.
    - This approach contrasts with the isolating algorithms of the attention economy.
3. **Open and Neutral Network**:
    
    - Geo Web's protocols are open-source, allowing for permissionless innovation and collaboration.
    - It aims to avoid centralized control, ensuring that the network remains open and beneficial to the public.
4. **Economic Incentives**:
    
    - By including economic incentives in its core protocols, Geo Web fosters innovation and counters centralizing forces.
    - The network's design encourages the productive use of digital land and supports public goods.

### Conclusion

**Geo Web** is a radical experiment aimed at shaping the future of augmented reality and spatial computing. It combines open-source protocols, public goods principles, and innovative technologies to create a shared, digital reality that benefits everyone. By leveraging blockchain and decentralized governance, Geo Web aims to provide a scalable, inclusive platform for AR content, ensuring that digital experiences enhance rather than isolate human interaction.
