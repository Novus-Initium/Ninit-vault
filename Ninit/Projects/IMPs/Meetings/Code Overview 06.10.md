### What?

- We are attesting/voting to the grantees projects which we then calculate the overall impact of the grantee based on the voting
	- Scores of 1-5
- We will use Pool, Custom Strategy, and Registry contracts to create a Round Manager QF application that allows Donors and Funders to score grantees using the attestations averaged score to cut off streaming/funding

- [x] Reach out to Graven to get in contact with SQF Dev for advice on Allo/Grants Stack
- [ ] Set up meeting with Sov


Design

- Create a round, explore projects, apply for a round
- Have it be all in once
