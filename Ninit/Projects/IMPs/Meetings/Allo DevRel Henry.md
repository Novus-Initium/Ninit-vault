Our objective: Create a scaffold eth2 grants stack template for other projects to implement custom strategies. We want to incorporate one custom strategy and experiment, that alters QF weights based on donors and funders attestations on projects.

We're following the allo-v1 guide to creating a custom voting strategy

1. Does Allo provide any tools or guidelines to help ensure compliance with relevant regulations? (KYC)
2. What is the best approach to interact with the ProjectRegistry from within the custom strategies? Should we use a direct contract call or an off-chain mechanism?
3. We want to implement the impact score to the profile and reference it in Voting Strategy, Payout strategy or both. What are the best files to adjust for custom strategies?

Direct impact on the allocation
