#### Onboarding

- We've been onboarding Noah (Project Manager/CFO), Quinlan (Project Manager/Developer), Marcus (Communications), and Tomni onto the Ninit team.
#### Development

- Adjusted the frontend of the attestations application
- Started testing with superfluid - a token streaming sdk
	- Consulted with Graven Prest and superfluid developers to understand how to integrate with the SDK.
	- Created a stream with fake DAI on sepolia Optimism.
	- Testing with batch based distributions for L1 sustainability.
	- Pragma 0.8.14 potentially compatible with the Doric Network.
	- Overall superfluid is a great option for streaming and batched based allocation mechanisms, we can set up direct streams/batch payments from funder to grantee and integrating attestations in to inform the flow of payments to grantees.
- Going over the imps repository with Quinlan to integrate Allo protocol contracts and attestations
