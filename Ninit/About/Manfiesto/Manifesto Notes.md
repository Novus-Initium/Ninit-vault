	Ninit believes firmly in a policy of open source governance, a political notion which encourages any democratic minded individuals to freely participate in policy creation, similar in practice to a wiki. 

	The International Bill of Human Rights is the collective term used for a series of human rights documents adopted and established by the United Nations. It includes the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted in 1948 as part of UN General Assembly Resolution 217. 

	Additionally, it encompasses two key international treaties: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), both of which were adopted in 1966 along with ICCPR's two Optional Protocols. These covenants officially became effective in 1976, following their ratification by a sufficient number of countries. 

		The Univerasal Declaration of Human Rights consists of 30 articles detailing every individual's "basic rights and fundamental freedoms" and affirming them as as inherent, inalienable, and applicable to all human beings.
		
		 Although not fully realized in practice, the UDHR sets a "common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations", and theoretically commits nations to recognize all humans as being "born free and equal in dignity and rights" regardless of their "nationality, place of residence, sex, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, language, or any other status". While not every soveign country repects these rights, Ninit strives to make acheiving them for all its central focus, through open source governance and decentralization. 

		Further basic rights are ountlined in both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The former focuses on labour rights, the right to health, the right to education, and the right to an adequate standard of living, while the latter highlights an individuals right to life, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, electoral rights and rights concerning due process and a fair trial.

		 "The future of virtual communities is connected to the future of everything else, starting with the most precious thing people have to gain or lose -- political freedom. The part played by communication technologies in the disintegration of communism, the way broadcast television pre-empted the American electoral process, the power of fax and CMC networks during times of political repression like Tienamen Square and the Soviet Coup attempt, the power of citizen electronic journalism, the power-maneuvering of law enforcement and intelligence agencies to restrict rights of citizen access and expression in cyberspace, all point to the future of CMC as a close correlate of future political scenarios"

		Ninit looks to leverage the most powerful tool ever known to man, the Internet, to connect our society more than ever before and open the political decision making in society directly to the individuals that make up the society.

You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear."

		Governance is not about final and permanent solutions, but an ever evolving and improving process of putting resources towards the public good. When societies operate effieciently, this works in a smooth process of continuous value for civilization, recycling resources for good.
