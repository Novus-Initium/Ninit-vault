Ninit Network is founded in an increasingly digital world with the central belief that emerging Web3 tech like decentralization and blockchain should be leveraged for public goods. These and related techs present an unprecedented opportunity in global history, one in which average people have more of chance then ever to empower themselves and directly participate in the political systems that govern them.  

Ninit looks to create and foster a diverse and inclusive Web3 ecosystem to promote a set of unalienable human rights. We see a Web3 future that is fair, transparent, and respecting of every humans Sovereign Rights in the digital era. Citizens should know how their tax dollars are spent and be free to redistribute them to causes that they feel align more with the public good. 

We will commit to creating and using technologies that enhance users control of their own data and identity, so that users may have a digital presence without fear of surveillance or unauthorized access. Our security and data privacy measures are always robust, professional grade and constantly updated to protect all personal information from malicious intent.

Our systems will be built on the principle of voluntary and consensual participation, and we will strive to promote these principles throughout our ecosystem and further reach.  We ensure transparency in how contributions and transactions are made, preventing any form of coercion or exploitation in our digital ecosystem. We will support measures that promote mental well-being and protect against digital harassment, protecting the dignity of all current and prospective members. 

The Network will continuously implement robust privacy protocols to safeguard all personal information, ensuring that individuals control how their data is used and shared in accordance with statutes such as the CCPA or GDPR. Security technologies including decentralized identifiers (DIDs), verifiable credentials and many others will be employed to further enhance user privacy.

Ninit looks to implement decentralized and transparent governance mechanisms that allow fair and unbiased decision-making both in our organization and larger political frameworks. Our systems will include dispute resolution frameworks that are open and accessible to all, ensuring justice and due process in case of any conflict.

We support the development of platforms that encourage freedom of thought, expression, and belief. Diverse viewpoints and innovative ideas will be fostered in an environment free from censorship, allowing individuals to share and access information freely.

Our commitment includes supporting decentralized communication networks that provide uncensored and reliable access to information. We will back platforms that enable free expression without fear of retaliation or suppression.

Ninit highly encourages the formation of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that allow individuals to collaborate and organize without central authority, leading to greater efficiently and ultimate return. Community-driven projects will be supported to promote inclusivity and collective governance. Hand in hand with this, we champion systems that facilitate direct participation in governance. Individuals will have tools to engage in decision-making processes that affect them, including voting and proposal-making, in a transparent and inclusive manner.

We aim to promote economic systems that provide fair opportunities for all, regardless of background. Decentralized finance (DeFi) initiatives will be supported to democratize access to financial services, as well as other public goods projects, overall reducing economic disparities and empowering individuals economically.

We will advocate for open and accessible educational resources that leverage blockchain for credentialing and knowledge sharing. Lifelong learning opportunities will be promoted through decentralized platforms, ensuring equitable access to education for all. This includes us supporting platforms that enable the sharing and preservation of cultural heritage and knowledge. Web3 technologies will be developed in line to support the diversity of cultures and languages, fostering a greater global collaboration with and understanding of one another.

We commit to sustainable development practices that minimize environmental impact. Our technologies will balance advancement with ecological preservation, ensuring a sustainable digital future. We will work towards ensuring that Web3 technologies are accessible to all, bridging digital divides and promoting inclusive participation in the digital economy.


We reaffirm our dedication to embedding human rights principles into the core of Web3 technologies. This manifesto is a call to all stakeholders, developers, and communities to uphold these principles and contribute to building a fair, inclusive, and decentralized digital world.

Ninit invites everyone to join us in this mission to create a decentralized ecosystem that respects and enhances the rights and freedoms of all individuals. Together, we can build a future where technology empowers humanity and upholds the dignity of every person.
