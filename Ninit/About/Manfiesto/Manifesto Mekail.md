### Nanifesto

New Beginnings remain residual cores to societal growth.[Delete: We aim not to be peacemakers or disruptors, but to provide the tools to fuel such battles.]

Our values are compromised and compartmentalized into three categories. Education, Consultation, and Creation. 

Our mission is community. To revive trust in hierarchical systems by transforming them into accountable, efficient, and mutually effective systems. Our mission is to provide the resources to help communities restructure degenerative social system, be that digitally, personally, or communally.  

It takes a nation to build a nation, we do not segregate or discriminate. To achieve a state of *ninitium* we must not leave anyone behind. We are beings willing to sacrifice efficiency, and willing to be slowed down for the right reasons. Individuals from all walks of like must be accounted for and always considered. This means forgiveness in others and ourselves for any and all perceived wrong doing. We will act in our best interest to protect ourselves from harm, and we believe rather avoiding it, we must address it. This ranges from bad actors, to scammers in the space. We recognize the struggles and do not judge the actions one takes. We provide tools, and direction for positive transformation, and understand that malicious actors while they can be dangerous, need love the most, be it directly or indirectly. We do not exclude anyone, for any reason. We do not suppress any voices, and act in the interest of humanity.

Our mission is to protect the meta initiative of ninit, and continuously allow, develop, and advocate for new governance systems and models to be discussed, developed, and tested. These models or any work we participate in can not act in any way as a barrier of information to any group of people. Any chance we get to help provide or allow access to information we must assist in any way we can.


We are not a peaceful protest. This is a declaration of war. [against moloch]

A war against ourselves. The parts of us we hide from. A war with others, those who refuse to look within with wide eyes. This war has been started long ago, and we choose to make a clear distinction which side we fight for. We are not just fighting for more efficient or robust political infrastructure. We are fighting for who we are. We fight for what we are. This battle stretches from galaxies and stars, to the atoms of our being, deep within ourselves. We recognize the illusion of self as a barrier to Ninitium, and wake up everyday fighting within, to fight together.
