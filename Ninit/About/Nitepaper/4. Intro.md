<aside> ðŸ’¡ The kernel, once it is loaded, finds init in 'sbin' and executes it. When init starts, it becomes the parent & grandparent of all of the processes that start up on your modern system. In simpler terms, it propagates the infrastructure of your operating system, giving life to your modern machine (USE THIS FOR BACKGROUND, BUT NOT AS A HIGHLIGHT..)

   (Background) ___> Close to the term Initium, Latin for beginnings;  relative to ordo or order, Novus Initium aims to build a foundation aimed at developing new and dynamic foundations. A highly dynamical tool, encouraging healthy redevlopement of current systems.
```

As Timothy C. May has famously predicted in the Crypto Anarchistâ€™s Manifesto, the wire clippers to the barbed wired fences is in our possession, and it is ultimately up to the people to decide how we will use and implement these new tools provided to us.

We are revolutionizing the way we approach governance, with a focus to bring more transparency and accountability. We believe this can start to unravel some of the core issues hindering the growth of our communities.

Our aim to devlop a foundation to develop foundations is multi-faceted; with radical development, comes a radical plan! This includes the developement of multiple projects, side projects and more, to expand our network and community, our reach, enhance funding mechanisms, test out different governance models, and more.

We have helped to foster and build teams of developers focused on regenerative projects and building public goods, and intend to emphasize the focus implementing and work around these new governance models and schemes, through various methods, such as minitaure hackathons operating on these very models themselves.

By revolutionizing the way we approach governance, and public goods, we can introduce higher levels of transparency and accountability, and begin to unravel some of the core issues hindering the growth of our communities, and abilities to coordinate within those communities.

Over 1m humans try to take their life each year; we wonder if a lack of community, transparency in their systems, and infrastructure could be at the roots of these core societal issues.

### _Why is coordination among humans so apparently difficult?_

```
   Many people feel cheated by their social operating systems, and the depression onset by those emotions of powerlessness greatly reduces our efficiency as a society, lowers our IQ, and makes it difficult for us to coordinate together; and I think we can begin to ask, beyond the trials and tribulations through the development of the DAO era, where is this emergence, and bridge between political infrastructure, and this new era of digital governance?
```

As we navigate through the 21st century, it has become increasingly evident that our current political and economic infrastructures are marred by inefficiencies, corruption, and an alarming lack of transparency. Many citizens crave and seek change, but the tooling and structures present make it difficult.

Many of us see ourselves in a society on the brink of transformation. As our conventional structures struggle to keep pace with the demands of our rapidly evolving world, the collective human consciousness, is clearly rapidly evolving, and outpacing our outdated systems, but through the emergence of DAOs, where is this connection, and why isnâ€™t it here yet?

Even though DAOs aim for democratic decision-making, they can face the issue of participation inequality, legal framework, decision making, enforcement mechanisms, coordination, and more.

## A Deeper Look

```
    Our journey started with a few startling statistics: 70% of Americans feel frustrated with the current system, while more than half don't trust their government to do what's right. We're not talking about just a small group of disgruntled citizens. We're talking about millions feeling disempowered, marginalized, and unheard.
```

If we dare to look, we can already see the harbingers of change. The collective consciousness of humanity is evolving, breaking free from age-old shackles of indoctrination and conformity. We are becoming a society that is not just complex, but also intelligent and self-aware. As we peel back the layers of illusion that have distorted our reality, we realize that we are in a rut, a dangerous precipice that could determine the fate of generations to come.

Yet, in the face of these challenges, there is a palpable sense of hope. A new generation is rising, equipped with the tools and the courage to bring about change. They are not just aware of the flaws in our system; they are ready to step up and take action. They are the true patriots, the ones who echo Thomas Jefferson's call for rebellion and rejuvenation.

We recognize that change is not without its adversaries. There are those who resist, clinging to the vestiges of a bygone era. But the winds of change are relentless, and in their wake, they will leave a world that is better, fairer, and more just.

The question is no longer whether change is possible. The real question is: how do we bring about this change?

### Further Down the Road

Novus Initium offers a roadmap to a future where power is decentralized, where governance is transparent, and where citizens are not just participants, but architects of their own path. We are leveraging the power of DTS systems and DAO infrastructure to create systems that are not just efficient, but also trustworthy and inclusive. Providing secure foundations to build out dynamic and revolutionary approaches to help citizens build new foundation, propose and adopt changes in a new manners, and ultimately find more community, will drive innovation, productivity and happiness.

What we are selling at Ninit is better than crack, better than corporate cola; beyond hope and hype. We are providing and driving the life force behind our deepest desires, that being community. We are doing the research behind ancient, modern and post modern governing systems, human behavior, and ultimately governance theory. Building out and testing EVM compatible applications, and various code models to represent new underlying structures.

Through various political systems such as Non-profits, HOAs, local, federal, and global governance / tax systems, schools and universities, etc.. We are developing the tools, structure, and wire clippers to make way for more efficient and transparent funding mechanisms, step by step.

By giving people more of a say in how resources are allocated through quality assured governance protocols, and contracts built on Ethereum, we can:

- Save an average of 157 billion dollars by tracking "lost" or "missing" funds within non-profits organizations.
- Increase their efficiency through larger political participation.
- Increase community.
- Prevent cases of fraud and embezzlement within HOA boards, management companies
- Prevent poor vendor selection. Many of which would benefit further from transparent reserve funds.

Over half of American's do not believe higher taxes would improve their happiness despite research suggesting otherwise, but we tend to focus on the aspect that we don't know what our money is always being used for, or have little to no say in how it is managed. Do people hate taxes, or just the lack or transparency, accountability, and community the current systems provide?

### Who is invited to the party?

Anyone seeking change within political systems they participate in, specifically people who would benefit off of more transparent and accountable systems; homeowners, investors, and eventually citizens apart of any governing community.

We also aim to invite the help of many projects and organizations aiming to revolutionize our economic & political states, and have began to take on many partnerships already.

Novus Initium brings forth the desires of the people, and gives them voice and purpose through technology.

Allow citizens to contribute to their communities in the ways they need.

Empower individuals by building and providing the frameworks in which future communities and organizations can operate on. Bring community and purpose back to the people.
