In our exploration of the digital frontier, the Novus Init system acknowledges the complexities that come with striving for a more equitable, transparent, and efficient society. We recognize that blockchain technology and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) provide an unprecedented opportunity to reshape our shared institutions and systems. Yet, we also understand that these transformative tools must be wielded with care, diligence, and an unwavering commitment to the principles of fairness, inclusivity, and accountability.

Our approach to this challenge is twofold. Technically, we delve deep into the mechanics of blockchain and DAOs, leveraging their inherent transparency and security to engineer solutions that are robust and versatile. We explore the potential of merit-based voting systems, consider the implications of varying DAO structures, and probe the depths of existing protocols and applications to derive insights and formulate strategies. In parallel, we keep a keen eye on the human element of our mission, knowing that technology is but a tool to serve the collective.

Thus, our second facet of approach is on the societal level. We strive to ensure that our technical innovations align with the needs and aspirations of the communities we serve. We engage in continuous dialogue with assisting parties, value diverse perspectives, and remain responsive to feedback. We aim to foster an ecosystem that encourages participation, nurtures innovation, and values integrity. This delicate balance of technical prowess and human-centric design forms the heart of our approach as we navigate the intricate dance of blockchain technology, DAOs, and societal transformation.

How can we sustain our mission and project? What approaches can be made within Ninit to ensure longevity in the project?

We can create sustainability and ensure longevity through various fundraising programs and schemes; many side projects incorporate schemes that will ultimately support the sustainability as well as progress towards our overall goals.

**MEV Mountain:**

Objective: Provide tooling, and resources for MEV, LP swap, and arbitrage opportunities. Build out bots to execute market making strategies to help members, selling access to bots or content as a way to store and compound capital.

Trading bots / exclusiveÂ  token gated AI/ML code and resources as well.

Approach: With a robust team of developers, Tokens will be granted to contributors for free, andÂ  as the products are built out, another series of tokens will be distributed to give access to some of the tooling and resources.

Members can learn to trade or exploit market making tactics for capital gain, and the server will be token gated; with a function that allows the tokens to burn if membership fee is not paid.

**RadRooms / WAGMI Wheelhouse:**

Objective: Build robust foundations and platforms that encourage building around political and economic infrastructure; while simultaneously providing initial concepts, and demos.

Approach: Build out some test projects, to become more familiar with public goods, and develop a community focused on building approaches to many of the described societal issues. These community members will have the opportunity to invest in a collection of ERC-721 tokens giving them power over how the revenue is spent through formulation of a hybrid DAO.

As we develop infrastructure for tracking public goods, we will reach out and try to cooperate with many public goods protocols and projects, and specifically non-profits to help integrate more accountable and transparent systems regarding funding, particularly with a focus on homelessness and global refugees for this particular project.

If the systems are deemed valuable, participants can choose to allocate some of theirÂ funds, or staking rewards to the Ninit foundation directly, to further allow us to continue building, and onboard them into the Ninit community by granting them $ROOM, an ERC-20 used to track contributions and grant power over allocation of funds through pull proposals which will be discussed in the Rad Room documents.

**HAODAO:**

Similar to Radrooms, but with a focus on integrating with HAOs, and building infrastructure and resources to help facilitate the process of integrating with larger scale systems.
