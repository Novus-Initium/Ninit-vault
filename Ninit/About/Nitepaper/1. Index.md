Novus Initium Nitepaper

Notes: How to organize our Nitepaper? It does not have to have the same format ex. Abstract -> Intro -> Background etc..
Purpose of Ninit is to educate the world on web3 and its potential, specifically regarding governing protocols. 

Ninit is a meta initiative aimed to address the lack of initiatives focused on cultivating, testing, and bridging new political infrastructure. Ninit believes new beginnings should be a human right and public good. As the needs of society is ever changing, the underlying infrastructure in which we operate should be dynamic and flexible enough to meet the rate of change. And within the very acceleration of that rate of change, the technology needed to build the tools of the next generation to coordinate effectively exist today, just as the technology for the tools need to create bitcoin existed in 2008. Now is our time to expand the boundaries and capabilities of what decentralized technologies and proper automation can do.
