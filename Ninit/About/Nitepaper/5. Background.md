” A Deeper Look “

```
    Our journey started with a few startling statistics: 70% of Americans feel frustrated with the current system, while more than half don't trust their government to do what's right. We're not talking about just a small group of disgruntled citizens. We're talking about millions feeling disempowered, marginalized, and unheard.

If we dare to look, we can already see the harbingers of change. The collective consciousness of humanity is evolving, breaking free from age-old shackles of indoctrination and conformity. We are becoming a society that is not just complex, but also intelligent and self-aware. As we peel back the layers of illusion that have distorted our reality, we realize that we are in a rut, a dangerous precipice that could determine the fate of generations to come.

Yet, in the face of these challenges, there is a palpable sense of hope. A new generation is rising, equipped with the tools and the courage to bring about change. They are not just aware of the flaws in our system; they are ready to step up and take action. They are the true patriots, the ones who echo Thomas Jefferson's call for rebellion and rejuvenation.

We recognize that change is not without its adversaries. There are those who resist, clinging to the vestiges of a bygone era. But the winds of change are relentless, and in their wake, they will leave a world that is better, fairer, and more just.

The question is no longer whether change is possible. The real question is: how do we bring about this change?

### Background Introduction:

By creating transparent and accountable systems for funding various public goods, citizens apart from communities can find more joy knowing where their taxes or funds are being allocated, or in having more of a voice in choosing its destination as well. Giving citizens more room to dance on the cosmic dance floor

With more financial bandwidth, issues regarding the environment, healthcare, or even education, can receive the funding they deserve.

With $188b lost every year just through tax evasion, we can begin to see that it's not the funding of public goods that is lacking, rather the archaic approach that is taken in issuing the funds, deciding where they are issued, and how it is ultimately spent. The funds are certainly there, but the architecture is already in mere shambles.

By focusing initially on Non-profits, and Homeowners Associations (HOAs), we aim to create a initial foundation for future adoption in larger governmental structures.

The growing dissatisfaction among Americans with the current political system presents an opportunity to market this change effectively.

At the core of our solution lies the integration of blockchain enabling real-time tracking of funds, significantly reducing the time and resources required for fraud and corruption investigations, from the previous 18 months, to 0 in the American tax system alone.

Through the use of various ERC protocols, we can create separate government accounts for each sub-sector, such as fire departments, local police, libraries, and infrastructure, ensuring that all transactions are public and easily traceable. This concept can be applied universally to most political structures needing to be built.

Contributors to public goods can visibly see where their funds are allocated, or alternatively can have a direct say in where they will be allocated, providing a form of social pressure, allowing for communities to play a more active role politically, and tying critical data to consumers, which can provide for more dynamic structures, and enhanced mechanics supporting new and improved reputation systems.

Stanford studies show a direct correlation between citizens that have a choice is where their tax money is being allocated, to those that don't. Studies show that many people are often willing to donate more of their money, if they have a say in where it goes.

Novus init empowers citizens by giving them the ability to choose where their tax dollars are allocated. By providing an interactive Dapp that displays funding information for each sector,

we not only enable people to support causes that they believe in but also encourage them

to contribute more when they know precisely where their money is going.

To ensure the project's continuous growth and development, we plan to generate funding through various innovative means.

We will explore our initial build of a decentralized GoFund me that allows people to support the projects they want, and monitor how their contributions are utilized; or they can donate to a public goods treasury.

This multi-faceted approach not only keeps the original team focused on the project but also fosters a community of supporters who are invested in the mission.

The potential impact the technology has on society is immense, as it addresses critical issues of transparency, accountability, and citizen empowerment.

We can reshape the landscape of public goods funding and pave the way for a brighter, more efficient future.

### Background:

A. The Evolution of the US Tax System and the Need for Reform

The US tax system has undergone various changes since its inception, striving to balance fairness and economic growth. While the current progressive model seeks to distribute the tax burden equitably, it faces numerous challenges that warrant a comprehensive reform. Complexity: The tax code is notoriously complicated, making it difficult for taxpayers to navigate and comply with.

This complexity also creates opportunities for tax evasion and fraud.

Inefficiency: The administration of the tax system requires significant resources, both in terms of manpower and financial costs, to collect and process taxes, as well as to investigate and prosecute tax fraud.

~ Corruption and Fraud: The existing tax system is vulnerable to corruption, as it relies heavily on manual processes and human intervention.

~ Fraud and corruption investigations can be costly and time-consuming, taking up to 15 months or more to complete.

~ Lack of Transparency: The current system does not provide clear insights into how tax dollars are being spent.

hold the government accountable for its spending decisions.

B. The Emergence of Blockchain Technology and Its Global Impact

Over the past decade, blockchain technology has emerged as a groundbreaking innovation with transformative potential. Its decentralized, transparent, and secure nature has attracted interest from various industries, including finance, supply chain management, and public administration. In underdeveloped countries, blockchain has proven invaluable in addressing economic instability, facilitating aid distribution, and providing alternative financial infrastructure.

These successes underscore the potential for blockchain technology to revolutionize traditional systems and processes.

Some examples are:

Venezuela: Amidst hyperinflation and a collapsing currency, the people of Venezuela have turned to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a more stable store of value and means of exchange. This has enabled them to protect their wealth and participate in the global economy.

Jordan: The United Nations has used the Ethereum blockchain to deliver aid to 10,000 refugees in Jordan, streamlining the process and ensuring that the funds reach the intended recipients without misappropriation.

Zimbabwe: Zimbabweans, grappling with political turmoil and a failing financial system, have embraced cryptocurrencies as an alternative to their local currency, providing them with a more stable and accessible form of money.

C. Blockchain Technology for the US Tax System

Given the success of blockchain technology in underdeveloped countries, it is worth exploring how it can be applied to the US tax system to address its shortcomings. By leveraging blockchain technology, the proposed Novus Init system aims to:

Improve Efficiency: Automate tax processes and reduce administrative costs, making the tax system more efficient and less reliant on human intervention.

Enhance Transparency: Provide real-time visibility into how tax dollars are spent, allowing taxpayers to hold the government accountable for its spending decisions.

Combat Corruption and Fraud: The immutable nature of blockchain technology can make it more difficult for fraudsters to manipulate the system, while the transparency and traceability of transactions can facilitate faster and more cost-effective investigations.

Empower Taxpayers: Allow citizens to choose where their tax money goes, aligning government spending with the priorities of its constituents and fostering a more engaged and satisfied taxpayer base.

It is of course difficult to fully integrate this system with current systems in place, and to work around that, our objective is to create employable initially fit for smaller structures such as local communities, Non-profits, and DAOs . Systems that foster public trust, and civic engagement, have a greater chance of efficiency.

### Background conclusion

Our goal and approach is hopefully fairly apparent. Throughout the remaining documents, we will provide more case studies, examples, and code, to further elaborate and expel our mission, approach, and progress.
