Protocols create the framework around how we operate as a society. Ninit initative does not use any specific protocols although many projects or tools used within the Ninit network, and N-init projects will have specific frameworks and techonologies used truly. Keep that in mind for the rest of this page.

Ninit can be used to host and employ a variety of DAPPs. These applications can create more efficient, transparent, and resilient systems for a range of sectors, including but not limited to finance, governance, and legal compliance. Some of the DAOs are:

1. **Finance DAOs:** In the financial sector, DAOs could be created to automate many complex tasks, reducing human error and increasing efficiency. For instance, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications could leverage smart contracts to automate lending and borrowing processes, create stablecoins, or enable peer-to-peer payments. This automation could result in cost-saving and increased accessibility for individuals and small businesses.
2. **Governance DAOs:** DAOs could be used to develop applications that simplify the process of decision-making within organizations. This could involve voting protocols that ensure fair and transparent decision-making, or the creation of automated systems for resolving disputes.
3. **Compliance DAOs:** One of the most compelling applications for DAOs within the Novus Init system could be in the realm of tax compliance. A DAO could be developed to create a decentralized application that automates the process of tax calculation, submission, and compliance. By integrating with various sources of income (such as wages, investment returns, and crypto-assets), the application could provide real-time tax estimates, automate deductions, and simplify the process of tax filing. Such a DAO would greatly reduce the burden of tax compliance for individuals and small businesses.
4. **Data Privacy DAOs:** Privacy-focused DAOs could be utilized to create protocols that protect user data while interacting with blockchain-based applications. This could involve developing systems that encrypt user data or provide users with granular control over who can access their information.
5. **Interoperability DAOs:** DAOs could also be leveraged to create protocols that enable different blockchains to interact with each other, improving the interoperability of the blockchain ecosystem. This would make it easier for developers to create applications that can operate across multiple blockchains.
6. **Innovation DAOs:** The MAGNETICS framework can guide the development of DAOs that foster innovation. These DAOs could create platforms for crowdsourcing ideas, funding research and development, or rewarding individuals and teams who come up with innovative solutions.
7. **Resource Allocation DAOs:** Using the principles of the MAGNETICS framework, DAOs could be created that optimize resource allocation within a system. This could include anything from how funds are distributed within a DAO to how computational resources are allocated within a decentralized network.

The potential applications for DAOs within the Novus Init system are vast. The key will be in identifying the most urgent and impactful areas where DAOs can make a difference, and then strategically developing and deploying these DAOs to maximize their benefit.

In the realm of DAOs, protocols play a pivotal role in defining how the organization operates. They set out the rules for decision-making, fund allocation, voting, and more. Different DAOs might use different protocols depending on their specific needs and goals.

Here are some of the currently used and available protocols in the DAO space:

1. **Financial Protocols:** Financial protocols are used to govern the financial operations of a DAO. They set out rules for how funds are managed, including how funds are allocated, how profits are distributed, and how financial transactions are recorded and audited. Examples of financial protocols include Yearn Finance and MakerDAO.
2. **Interoperability Protocols:** These protocols are designed to enable interaction between different blockchain networks. They allow DAOs to operate across multiple blockchains, expanding their reach and functionality. Examples of interoperability protocols include Polkadot and Cosmos.
3. **Smart Contract Protocols:** Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They form the backbone of most DAOs, automating the execution of agreements when certain conditions are met. Ethereum is the most well-known protocol supporting smart contracts, but other platforms like Binance Smart Chain, Cardano, and Tezos also support smart contracts.
4. **Decentralized Storage Protocols:** These protocols provide decentralized data storage solutions, ensuring that the DAO's data is not controlled by any single entity. Examples include protocols like Filecoin and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System).
5. **Privacy Protocols:** Privacy protocols add an additional layer of privacy to transactions, enhancing the security of DAOs. Examples include protocols like Zcash and Monero, which provide privacy features.
6. **Governance Protocols & DAOs:** These are one of the most common types of protocols used by DAOs. They establish the rules for how decisions are made within the DAO. This might include how proposals are submitted, how voting is conducted, and what percentage of votes are needed for a proposal to pass. Examples of governance protocols include Aragon, DAOstack, Moloch DAO, and more.

- **Aragon**: Aragon is a platform that enables users to create and manage DAOs. It comes with tools for governance, fundraising, and more. Aragon's governance protocol allows for the creation of proposals, voting, and implementation of the results of these votes. It also provides a framework for the creation of bylaws that dictate how the organization operates.
- **DAOstack**: DAOstack is another platform for DAO creation and management. Its governance protocol, known as "Holographic Consensus", aims to ensure large-scale, open participation while maintaining efficient decision-making. It uses a system of "predictors" who stake tokens on proposals they believe will pass, thereby influencing which proposals get more attention.
- **MolochDAO**: MolochDAO is a specific type of DAO that focuses on simplicity and minimizing coordination efforts among members. Its governance protocol is very straightforward: members can only vote on proposals to either approve funding or to admit new members. MolochDAO inspired other DAOs like MetaCartel and The LAO with its minimalistic approach.
- **Gnosis**: Gnosis offers a range of products, including a platform for creating DAOs. It provides a unique governance protocol where decisions can be made not just through simple majority vote, but also through more complex mechanisms like quadratic voting and futarchy (prediction markets for decision making).
- **Colony**: Colony provides a platform for creating DAOs with a focus on decentralized collaboration. Its governance protocol allows for decision-making to be spread across the organization, with individuals earning influence based on their contributions.
- **Kyber Network**: Although primarily a decentralized exchange, Kyber Network also incorporates a governance protocol, where KNC (Kyber Network Crystal) token holders can vote on various proposals affecting the network’s parameters.

Given their Ethereum foundation, these DAOs are inherently compatible with Ethereum's token standards, most notably ERC20 and ERC721.

1. **ERC20**: This is the standard interface for tokens, akin to the standard interface for a phone charger. ERC20 tokens are fungible, meaning each token is identical to every other token; it's the kind of token used in ICOs. Almost all of these DAOs use ERC20 tokens for their governance protocols. For example, DAOstack's GEN tokens, Gnosis' GNO tokens, and Kyber's KNC tokens are all ERC20.
2. **ERC721**: This is a standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), meaning each token is unique. This standard is used primarily for digital collectibles like CryptoKitties, but it also has potential use cases in governance. For example, a DAO could issue unique ERC721 tokens representing ownership of specific assets or rights within the organization, or data regarding internal and external reputation.

In addition to these token standards, these DAOs also often interact with Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that improve the platform's functionality and expand its potential uses. For example:

- **EIP-712 (Typed Structured Data Hashing and Signing)**: This EIP presents a standard way of structuring and signing data, providing better security for users when signing transactions. DAO platforms can use this EIP to improve the safety of their governance transactions.
- **EIP-1820 (Pseudo-introspection Registry Contract)**: This EIP is a standard registry smart contract where any address (contract or regular account) can register which interface it supports and which contract is responsible for its implementation. DAO platforms could utilize this EIP to interact with other contracts more efficiently.
- **EIP-1155 (Multi-Token Standard)**: This EIP allows for a single contract to manage multiple token types (both fungible and non-fungible), potentially simplifying the way DAOs manage their internal tokens.
(We may want to provide more technical details about the blockchain and DAO technologies being used.) This could include information on consensus mechanisms, encryption, or the specific features of ERC 6506, and other technologies.

### Protocol-based DAOs

Protocol-based DAOs are the most common type responsible for the organization’s day-to-day operations. Protocol DAOs are responsible for developing the underlying protocol governing the blockchain network. An alternative to protocol DAOs is Application DAOs, which focus on creating [decentralized applications](https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/a-beginners-guide-to-decentralized-applications/).

a merit-based voting system means that the members of the DAO get rewards for their value addition.

This governance model is ideal for organizations looking to reward their members for their contributions. It also ensures that only the most qualified members make decisions for the DAO

Protocols to consider through development of systems:

1. ERC-1798: Liquid Democracy Voting Standard: This proposal outlines a standard for implementing liquid democracy in Ethereum smart contracts. Liquid democracy is a governance model that allows token holders to delegate their votes to others, creating a more flexible and scalable decision-making process.
2. ERC-2535: Diamond Standard: The Diamond Standard is a proposal for creating upgradeable and modular smart contracts on Ethereum. This standard can be used to build complex DAOs with multiple facets, allowing for the efficient management and organization of a DAO's functionality and governance.
