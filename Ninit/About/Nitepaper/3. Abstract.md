### Novus Initium

Many citizens seek and crave change, but the current tooling and structures make it inaccessible to a vast [majority.](http://majority.In)

As we navigate through the 21st century, it has become increasingly evident that our current political and economic infrastructures are marred by inefficiencies, corruption, and an alarming lack of transparency.

In our Nitepaper we will begin exploring options on how to adapt to the drivers of societal change, how government may be affected, and ways we can properly adapt.

(copy writers job will help you translate these paragraphs into bullet points)

We delve into the heart of community-centric models that leverage cutting-edge technology, empowering communities to redesign their political structures from the grassroots level up, fostering a more responsive and transparent governance ecosystem.

Along with this we will focus on the importance of diminishing corruption, how to approach a problem like this, and many alternative ways to address the inclining rate of distrust within our government, and the governance within parallel systems. We will provide examples of technical systems and tools that can enable and assist communities to redesign their political infrastructures, and ultimately make public goods spending specifically, more viable, inclusive, and transparent.

It's apparent that the debilitating effects of our current coordination deficiencies permeate both individual and societal health, leaving a trail of cascading adversities. However, we believe in the potential of the collective. As we lay out a roadmap for the future, we remain hopeful that together, we can meet the demands of the future with agility, innovation, and a renewed sense of social solidarity.

Non-profit organizations in the United States control over $2 trillion in assets, according to the National Center for Charitable Statistics.

The American tax system collects over $3.5 trillion each year, according to the IRS.

Despite being one of the world's oldest democracies, the United States often sees less than 60% of its eligible voters participate in presidential elections, according to the United States Elections Project.

Nearly 40 million Americans live in poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau,

The National Center for Health Statistics reports that over 7% of adults needed but did not receive one or more healthcare services due to cost

Poor social health, poverty, lack of social programs and overall coordination lie at the roots of our inabilities to healthily progress as a species. Giving citizens more political power and insights on the inner mechanics of their social systems is more possible than ever.

_How can we improve the bleak and opaque social operating systems we currently operate on?_

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/c55c6f07-9662-49c9-8d10-72e1bd7c7a2d/Untitled.png)

In our pursuit of enhancing community engagement we must carefully consider the operating systems and models underpinning our communities and organizations.

These systems, which have evolved over thousands of years, remain central to our collective existence yet the opaque and arcane nature of many of these systems often undermines trust and inhibits meaningful community interaction.

This opacity and lack of coordination can discourage engagement, and make it difficult and inefficient to operate. Using dynamic smart contracts further elaborated on in the technical documents, we can mitigate many of the social issues described above; corruption and fraud, even litigatory behavior amongst HOAs and Homeowners, Non-profits, and have more control over public healthcare systems. We can automate, and further democratize and legitimatize our voting systems, generate more trust, participation, and symbiosis within our underlying social infrastructures, enhance social coordination and more by focusing on the development of our political infrastructures, underlying governance models, and approaches on bridging the two.

We can quantitatively measure the relative impact on mental well being, and general happiness within a community or individual, and research supports the underlying facts that humans are much happier and more willing to fund and pay taxes when they know where their money is going. It also supports that happiness and emotional well being has a direct relation to IQ, and can inherently allow for a more productive, efficient, happier, and ultimately better society.

Posing the right questions can guide us in reshaping these structures:

How can we make engagement with proactive and regenerative communities more enticing? Can we embed these principles into existing, perhaps degenerative, communities? How might we remove the societal 'weeds' that dampen our sense of community and happiness, thereby paving the way for enhanced emotional well-being?

By delving into these questions, we aim to illuminate the root causes of societal ailments and explore potential remedies. This paper proposes a shift in focus - from surface-level symptoms to underlying roots, with a goal of catalyzing profound, lasting social impact.
