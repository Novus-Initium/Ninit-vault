Ninit is a meta initiative aimed to address the lack of initiatives and focus on cultivating, testing, and bridging new political infrastructure. Ninit believes new beginnings should be a human right and public good. As the needs of society is ever changing, the underlying infrastructure in which we operate should be dynamic and flexible enough to meet the rate of change. And within the very acceleration of that rate of change, the technology needed to build the tools of the next generation to coordinate effectively exist today, just as the technology for the tools need to create bitcoin existed in 2008. Now is our time to expand the boundaries and capabilities of what decentralized technologies and proper automation, and abstraction can do.


From governing logic, to simplifying UI within capital formation, allocation, and reporting mechanisms, our goal is to fill the gaps that disincentives people from funding public goods due to lack of trust and transparency. 

We want to help organizations be more trustworthy, from local, to state and national levels.

Being a complex process with multiple moving parts, this includes but isn’t limited to web3 education; bringing on more web3 developers, and helping technologically illiterate people set up wallets and understand the tech to a degree where they understand it a bit better addressing multiple points of failure in trust.

We believe social issues such as lack of health care, global warming, corporate and non-profit embezzlement, all stem from a lack of transparency at a capital level. 

The root of our coordination failures stem from misallocated capital.

The root of our misallocated capital comes from lack of transparency, and accountability.

The root of lack of transparency and accountability comes from lack of governance, incentives, and power distributions.

Ninit focuses on government infrastructure as a public good;

Governance is a public good, as well as its structure, and citizens / organizations should focus more efforts on innovating secure, transparent, and accountable infrastructures. 

Funding projects, and projects that’s support these projects that bring an initial focus on governance structures as a public good and integrating and testing these structures directly through their funding is an exciting an innovating experiment. Ninit needs funding to help build the tools required for the next frontier of global governance.
